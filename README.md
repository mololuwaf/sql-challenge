# sql-challenge
This SQL challenge involved working with employee data provided by a company concerning the period of 1980-1990.
There were 6 CSV files provided, each file containing different data relevant to the company's human resources. 
I initialised the challenge with an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualise the relationships between the different datasets. Using the schema created as a byproduct of my ERD, I succesfully imported the data into the appropriate tables and then wrote SQL Queries in postgreSQL to perform data analysis for the company thus providing the information that was demanded. 

In this repository, there are two ERD diagrams created on quickDBD, the first being my initial attempt which I used to carry out my analysis. however, I used the 'ALTER TABLE' function to add my primary and composite key Constraints where necessary to clean up my schema.  

This challenge enabled me to use SQL to draw many significant and meaningful insights into the Company which in turn can inform future decisions.
